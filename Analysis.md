## Usage Trends

The number of trips for members is much more than for casual customers throughout the year. In the following visualizations, you can see a difference in the behavior of Casual Customers vs. Annual members.

* Generally, passenger traffic in summer is much more than in winter. The number of trips follows a seasonal trend in which more trips are made during warm seasons in contrast with cold seasons. Most trips start and end within the traffic rush hours meaning that the bike-sharing system is used as a solution for NYC traffic congestion. There are similarities and differences in the behavior of members and casual customers.

* Trip Duration Outliers

For members, the trip duration doesn't exceed 2 days and usually is about 1 day or less. For casual customers, the trip duration sometimes exceeds a few days and even 20-30 days, which may be explained by the loss, misuse of bikes or could mean that the bike has gone to maintenance.
